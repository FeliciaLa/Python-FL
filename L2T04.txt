- better data sharing
- improved data integration
- minimised data inconsistency 
- improved data access
- improved decision making 
- increased end user productivity

3. What is the difference between data and information?

Data are raw facts. Raw data therefore has not yet been processed to reveal its meaning.

It helps to describe the content, context, quality, condition, and other characteristics of data.
